# Project 1 - FYS4150 Computational Physics 

This repository contains all files and results for project 1 in addition to the report.

### Prerequisites

The code is written in c++. Compiling software is required. In order to compile and run the armadillo files, one also needs to have the library Armadillo dowloaded.

## Running the programs

Start by compiling the c++ programs. 

1b is exectuted with 3 command line argumens, typically 

```
